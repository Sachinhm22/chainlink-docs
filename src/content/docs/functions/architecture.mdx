# Chainlink Functions — Architecture

This diagram shows the full request lifecycle.

E --> B;" />

## Flow Explanation

1. User calls the smart contract  
2. Smart contract emits a Functions request  
3. Chainlink DON listens for the request  
4. Offchain JS executes  
5. Response is signed  
6. Result is returned onchain
